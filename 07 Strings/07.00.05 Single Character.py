"""A slice gives from the given string one character or some fragment: substring or subsequence.

The simplest form of slice is a single character slice: S[i] gives ith character of the string. Now, the hardest thing to get in all this string business: indexing starts at 0; the first element has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on.

That is, if S='Hello', S[0]=='H', S[1]=='e', S[2]=='l', S[3]=='l', S[4]=='o'."""

S = 'Hello'
print(S[0])
print(S[1])
print(S[2])
print(S[3])
print(S[4])
