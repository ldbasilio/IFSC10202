# We are already used to creating files. We can open up any text editor and begin type. When we are finished with a line and go to the next line, we press 
# the Enter key. When this key is pressed, a special character, known as a linefeed, is inserted in the file. We can specify the linefeed in Python as \n. 
# Note that this is the backslash (above the enter key) and not the forward slash (below and to the left of the enter key).

# Assume we have the following file:

# Hello! 
# Welcome to demofile.txt
# This file is for testing purposes.
# Good Luck!

# Instructions

# Each line in the file ends with a newline character (also called a linefeed character or LF). Note that the last line does not have a newline character. 
# The file actually contain the following, where \n represent the linefeed character:

# Hello!\nWelcome to demofile.txt\nThis file is for testing purposes.\nGood Luck!
